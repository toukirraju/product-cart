## Description 
This project create using React-redux to save data from inpute field and clicking add product then store data into the Redux store. The data from the Redux store will be displayed in product container, and people can add product on their own product cart by clicking Add to cart button. 


## Features


* There will be nothing in the "Initially State". When we first visit the site, it should look like no product is visible and it should be completely blank. It shows "No Product Found" there, but the product list should be empty.

* On the right-hand side of the "Template," there is an "Add New Product" section. When we click the "Add Product" button after providing the product information, it should be saved in the Redux Store. Then, the product should be displayed on the left side of the Product grid view.

Note: If we provide the image link in the "Image URL," the image will be loaded from that link.

* While adding a product, if the quantity exceeds the given amount, it should not be added to the cart. After the product is added, the "Add to Cart" button should be disabled.

* Each time we click "Add to Cart," the quantity of that product should decrease.

* On the right-hand side of the top section, a green Cart icon will show how many products have been added to the cart. If the same product is added 10 times, the green Cart icon will show "10."

* Clicking the green Cart icon will take us to another page where we can see the list of products added to the cart, and the details of the bill will be displayed on the right side. When we click the Home menu, it will display the Home page.
